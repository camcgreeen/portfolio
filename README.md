# Portfolio website ðŸ˜€

Hello! Thanks for having a look at the repo for my personal portfolio website. I wanted to create something to showcase some of the projects I've been working on lately.

## Getting started
- `npm install`
- `npm start` for development
- `npm build` for production

Please let me know your thoughts!
